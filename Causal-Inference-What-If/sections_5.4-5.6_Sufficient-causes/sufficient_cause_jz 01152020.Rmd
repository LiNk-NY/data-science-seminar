Review
============================
- *Interaction* requires joint intervention
- joint intervention: interventions on two or more treatments
- definition of interaction between treatment A (apple) and E (egg) on the additive scale, causal effect difference
$$\operatorname{Pr}\left[Y^{a=1,e=1}=1\right]-\operatorname{Pr}\left[Y^{a=0,e=1}=1\right]\neq\operatorname{Pr}\left[Y^{a=1,e=0}=1\right]-\operatorname{Pr}\left[Y^{a=0,e=0}=1\right] $$
- sufficient condition to identify interaction is that exchangability, positivity, and consistency are all satisfied for each treatment
- if E is randomly assigned, interaction = effect modification

- deterministic counterfactual responses
- no interaction: type 1,4,6,11,13,16
- presence of interaction:
  - develop the outcome under 1 out of 4 treatment combination: type 8,12,14,15
  - develop the outcome under 2 out of 4 treatment combination: type 7,10
  - develop the outcome under 3 out of 4 treatment combination: type 2,3,5,9

- causal mechanisms involved in the interaction between two treatments
- sufficient-component causes: sufficient causes and their components

#Sufficient causes interactions
- *Interaction* under counterfactual-framework - contrast of counterfactual quantities
- *Interaction* under sufficient-component-cause-framework - co-existence in sufficient cause
    - synergistic  (A = 1 and E = 1)
    - antagonistic (A = 1 and E = 0, A = 0 and E = 1)
- special case where we don't need knowledge of sufficient causes and components specification: inequality holds

$$\operatorname{Pr}\left[Y^{a=1,e=1}=1\right]-\operatorname{Pr}\left[Y^{a=0,e=1}=1\right]>\operatorname{Pr}\left[Y^{a=1,e=0}=1\right] $$

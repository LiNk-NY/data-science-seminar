##Exercise 1
This question involves the use of simple linear regression on the Auto data set.

(a) Use the lm() function to perform a simple linear regression with
mpg as the response and horsepower as the predictor. Use the
summary() function to print the results. Comment on the output.

For example:
i. Is there a relationship between the predictor and the response?
ii. How strong is the relationship between the predictor and
the response?
iii. Is the relationship between the predictor and the response
positive or negative?
iv. What is the predicted mpg associated with a horsepower of
98? What are the associated 95% confidence and prediction
intervals?

(b) Plot the response and the predictor. Use the abline() function
to display the least squares regression line.

(c) Use the plot() function to produce diagnostic plots of the least
squares regression fit. Comment on any problems you see with
the fit.

##Exercise 2
In this exercise we will create some simulated data and will fit simple
linear regression models to it. Make sure to use set.seed(1) prior to
starting part (a) to ensure consistent results.

(a) Using the rnorm() function, create a vector, x, containing 100
observations drawn from a N(0,1) distribution. This represents
a feature, X.

(b) Using the rnorm() function, create a vector, eps, containing 100
observations drawn from a N(0,0.25) distribution i.e. a normal
distribution with mean zero and variance 0.25.

(c) Using x and eps, generate a vector y according to the model
Y = ???1 + 0.5X + \(\epsilon\)
What is the length of the vector y? What are the values of ??0
and ??1 in this linear model?

(d) Create a scatterplot displaying the relationship between x and
y. Comment on what you observe.

(e) Fit a least squares linear model to predict y using x. Comment
on the model obtained. How do \(\hat\beta_0\) and \(\hat\beta_1\) compare to ??0 and
??1?

(f) Display the least squares line on the scatterplot obtained in (d).
Draw the population regression line on the plot, in a different
color. Use the legend() command to create an appropriate legend.
